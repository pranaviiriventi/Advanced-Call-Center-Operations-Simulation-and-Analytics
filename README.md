# Advanced Call Center Operations Simulation

## Project Overview
This project develops a comprehensive simulation of call center operations, focusing on the intricacies of managing customer service interactions, employee efficiency, and operational decisions. Utilizing Python and the `simpy` library, the simulation models basic call handling processes, incorporates dynamic support times through predictive modeling, and explores the impacts of priority queues and employee skill levels on service quality.

## Key Features
- **Basic Call Center Simulation:** Models the foundational aspects of call center operations, including customer arrivals, service processes, and resource management.
- Dynamic Support Time Prediction: Enhances the simulation realism by adjusting call handling times based on query complexity, using a predictive model built with `RandomForestRegressor`.
- Priority Queue Implementation: Simulates prioritized handling for VIP customers, reflecting real-world customer service practices.
- Employee Skill Level Variation: Examines the effects of differing employee skill levels on call handling efficiency and overall operational effectiveness.
- Data Analysis and Visualization: Provides insightful analysis of the simulation outcomes, leveraging `pandas` for data manipulation and `matplotlib` for visual representation of key metrics.

## Technologies Used
- Python
- SimPy (for event-based simulation)
- NumPy (for numerical computations)
- pandas (for data analysis)
- scikit-learn (for predictive modeling)
- matplotlib (for data visualization)

## Getting Started
To run this simulation on your local machine, follow these steps:

1. Ensure you have Python installed. This project was developed using Python 3.8.
2. Install the required Python libraries:
3. Clone this repository or download the Jupyter Notebook (`call_center_simulator.ipynb`).
4. Open the notebook in Jupyter Lab or Jupyter Notebook and run the cells sequentially to observe the simulation in action.

## Insights and Findings
The simulation revealed several key insights into call center operations, including the critical role of employee skill levels in managing call handling times, the effectiveness of priority queues in improving service levels for VIP customers, and the potential of predictive modeling to optimize operational decisions.

Future enhancements could include integrating real-world call center data for model training, exploring the impact of customer satisfaction metrics, and implementing machine learning algorithms for real-time resource allocation.
